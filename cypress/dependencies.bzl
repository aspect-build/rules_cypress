# WARNING: any changes in this function may be BREAKING CHANGES for users
# because we'll fetch a dependency which may be different from one that
# they were previously fetching later in their WORKSPACE setup, and now
# ours took precedence. Such breakages are challenging for users, so any
# changes in this function should be marked as BREAKING in the commit message
# and released only in semver majors.
# This is all fixed by bzlmod, so we just tolerate it for now.
